# Sample Application for NSQSharp

I needed a simple, lightweight messaging framework for a project I was on recently, and NSQ fit the bill.
Fortunately, [Jud White](https://github.com/judwhite) has a great .Net solution in place, I just needed to play with it and make sure it would work in my
scenario. This is the sample app I created. You are welcome to fork it, improve it, download it, etc.
